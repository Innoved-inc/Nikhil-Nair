            I picked Diary of a Wimpy Kid as my topic because it is one of my favorite series of books and its extremely funny. I want
            to build websites so I can show off what I like. My favorite part of building my website is building the home
            page because you get to be creative the most on that page and its really fun. My biggest challenge while making
            my website was getting things where I wanted them to be on css. My next website will be about Harry Potter, which
            is also one of my favorite series, as it has lots of twists and is mysterious. I do enjoy making websites.
